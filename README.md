> Now [THIS](https://youtu.be/8bLkcCZFKvA) Is Podracing  


Leoracer is a making project that aims to create an alternative game controller for the now long forgotten [Pod Racer Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Racer) developed by LucasArts and recently made available for modern Windows machines through [GoG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_episode_i_racer).  
The controller features a double airplane-throttle layout, which can tilt forwards (thus handling the pod's thrust) and tilt sideways (thus handling the pod's tilting): in order to turn left, the player has to reduce throttle to the right side, and vice versa.  
All of this is to provide a more "realistic" control scheme through a D-Input compliant controller.
